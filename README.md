# EcoVision-AI-Smart-Automotive-Detection-for-Sustainable-Mobility
An AI-powered project designed to detect and classify vehicles and road objects in real time using computer vision. This system helps enhance automotive safety by identifying objects such as cars, pedestrians, traffic signs, and obstacles from video or camera input.

Key Features
1. AI-powered detection using YOLOv8 pretrained weights
2. Supports both image and video input						
3. Bounding box visualization with class labels and confidence scores
4. Easy to run in Google Colab or locally
5. Minimal setup with automatic dependency handling
